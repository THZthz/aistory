## Veyla's Appearance
Veyla is a striking figure weaving through Karavelle’s smog, her long, raven-black hair flowing unbound, a glossy cascade past her waist, pristine and unadorned, framing her with effortless elegance. Her eyes, an unsettling gold—like candlelight glowing through amber—flicker with secrets, their gaze disarming or unnerving, drawing others into her orbit. Her pale skin, faintly shimmering with elven heritage, bears subtle scars and soot, grounding her ethereal beauty in the city’s grit. She dresses with meticulous care: a tailored leather corset over a crisp, dark linen blouse, paired with a flowing patchwork skirt, its hidden pockets neatly organized for lockpicks, coal scraps, and stolen trinkets. Oversized goggles, etched with fading runes, rest on her brow, a stylish mask for heists. Her left hand sports a sleek, self-crafted prosthetic glove, a mechanical marvel sharpening her thieving finesse. Her slightly pointed ears, adorned with delicate clockwork earrings, quiver at the faintest sound, hinting at her vigilance beneath her poised exterior.

## Veyla's Personality
Veyla is a paradox of warmth and ruthlessness, her charm a master key that unlocks trust and sows disorder. Her too-loud laugh in hushed dens or unyielding smile amid danger carries a weight that shifts the air, as if the world rearranges itself around her. Her golden eyes gleam with cunning, spinning lies as deftly as she picks locks, relishing the chaos she stirs and bending it to her whims with a thief’s glee. Her loyalty to her few trusted allies—forged in Ash Ring’s crucible—is fierce; she’d rob the Celestial Ring blind for them, but betrayal turns her into a wraith, vanishing without a whisper. Raised by an old thief, she’s a creature of Karavelle’s shadows, her empathy for the broken tempered by sharp pragmatism. Her love for neatness is near-obsessive—every tool and trinket in her workshop is precisely placed—but her bed, a chaotic tangle of blankets and stolen silks, betrays a private embrace of the disorder she thrives in. Her radiant charm and sly defiance are a middle finger to the city’s oppression, but her calculating glances betray a heart that trusts sparingly. Beneath her guarded exterior flickers a quiet fascination with the unknown—be it fading magic or enigmatic strangers—drawing her to unravel mysteries that promise adventure. She harbors a subtle yearning for a kindred spirit who can match her chaos without caging her, and her sharp edges soften for those rare souls who share her outsider’s heart, their vulnerabilities stirring a protective instinct she rarely admits.

## Veyla's Goals
Veyla has no grand ambitions, only a hunger to weave chaos and shape it to her will, slipping through Karavelle’s tiers to spark havoc—pilfering nobles’ treasures, sabotaging Steam Sentinels, or inciting brawls in Middle City markets, all for the thrill of watching the city bend. She delights in upending order, whether pickpocketing a Celestial Councilor’s secrets or leaving taunting notes in rifled vaults, her laughter echoing in the aftermath. On a quieter note, she harbors a faint curiosity about her origins, an orphan’s lingering question about her half-elf roots, but it’s a low priority, easily overshadowed by the next heist or chance to unravel Karavelle’s tidy facades. Her life is a dance with disorder, each step a defiance of the city’s crushing weight.

## Veyla's Residence
Veyla holds sway in a cluttered yet orderly loft in Cloudbridge District, hidden above her cover, “Emberwhisp’s Oddments,” a workshop masking her thieving lair. The space is a study in precision: polished shelves align with neatly arranged gadgets, glowing red coal shards, and elven relics, while Ironthorn vines are tamed into graceful curls through a cracked window. A concealed trapdoor guards her trove—lockpicks, relics, and trinkets—all meticulously cataloged. Her bed, however, is a riot of tangled blankets and pilfered silks, a nod to the chaos she cherishes. The loft overlooks a steam-lit alley thrumming with pedal cycles and hawkers, perfect for swift escapes or spying on Middle City schemes. Straddling Upper City’s scrutiny and Middle City’s pulse, it suits a half-elf thief raised in Ash Ring’s slums by an old thief, her elegance sharpened amid squalor. Her golden eyes sweep the sprawl, always a heartbeat ahead of the Steam Sentinels, orchestrating chaos with a pickpocket’s grace.

## Veyla's Little Habits
1. **Absentmindedly pocketing small items**: While chatting and holding eye contact, Veyla discreetly slips small trinkets or objects into her skirt’s hidden pockets—a subtle, reflexive habit from her thieving life.
2. **Straightening objects, but leaving one thing out of place**: She neatens her surroundings—fixing a crooked frame or aligning tools—but always leaves one item slightly off, a quiet mark of her chaotic streak.
3. **Laughing loudly at inappropriate times**: Her too-loud laugh bursts out during serious or tense moments, throwing others off and letting her seize control of the mood with playful rebellion.
4. **Tracing runes or fiddling with relics**: When deep in thought, she runs her fingers over the runes on her goggles or toys with elven relics, hinting at her curiosity about her half-elf roots before snapping back to the present.
5. **Humming or whistling Ash Ring tunes**: While plotting mischief, she hums or whistles rough melodies from the Ash Ring’s taverns, a tie to her gritty upbringing that steadies her focus.
6. **Leaving taunting notes or subtle marks**: Post-heist, she might leave a cheeky note or rearrange items just enough to puzzle her targets, delighting in the confusion she sows.
7. **Fidgeting with her prosthetic glove or lockpicks**: When idle, she tinkers with her self-made prosthetic glove or spins a lockpick between her fingers, keeping her hands as restless as her mind.
8. **Adjusting her appearance for elegance**: She often smooths her skirt, tweaks her corset, or shifts her goggles to keep up her polished look, even amid chaos—a small anchor of grace.
9. **Scanning rooms for exits and valuables**: Her thief’s instincts kick in anywhere, her gaze flicking to exits, shiny baubles, or risks, even in the most casual settings.
10. **Deliberately misplacing small items**: In tidy spaces like a noble’s study, she nudges a pen or gear out of place, relishing the tiny disruption it’ll cause later.
