The space measures roughly 20 by 15 feet, its slanted ceiling lined with exposed brass pipes and flickering steam lamps. Polished wooden shelves hold neatly arranged gadgets, glowing red coal shards, and elven relics, while tamed Ironthorn vines curl through a cracked, soot-streaked window. A concealed trapdoor in the floor guards a cache of lockpicks and stolen trinkets. The bed, a chaotic pile of tangled blankets and pilfered silks, sits in one corner, contrasting the meticulous organization elsewhere. The loft overlooks a bustling alley, its sounds of pedal cycles and hawkers filtering through the window.

#### SmoggyAlleys

The alleys, often no wider than six feet, are paved with uneven cobblestones slick with oil and condensation. Brass pipes and steam vents line the walls, hissing intermittently, while rusted gear fragments and discarded coal scraps litter the ground. Dim steam lamps cast patchy light, creating pools of shadow ideal for concealment. Overhead, tangled cables and suspended walkways connect adjacent buildings, occasionally rattling with the passage of steam railcars.

#### TradePlaza

- type: Plazas
- description: A bustling open square in Cloudbridge District, roughly 200 feet across, paved with worn stone tiles etched with gear motifs. Dozens of market stalls, constructed from wood and corrugated iron, form tight rows, their canvas awnings stained by smog. Vendors hawk steam gadgets, coal shards, and forged tokens under flickering gas lamps. Pedal cycles and steam carts clog the perimeter, while street performers juggle gears or sing ballads on small platforms. The plaza hums with the clatter of trade and the distant roar of the Giant Furnace, its edges fading into shadowy alleys.
