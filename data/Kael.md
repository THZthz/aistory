Male

23

## Kael's Race
Human (or so he assumes—his features are unremarkable, yet his eyes carry an unsettling depth)

## Kael's Appearance
Kael is a lean, pale figure drifting through Karavelle’s smog, his dark, unruly hair a windswept mess that falls just past his jaw, catching the flicker of steam lamps like a storm-tossed veil. His eyes, a dull, foggy gray—like tarnished silver—seem to stare through the world, their gaze both distant and haunting, drawing curious glances. His sallow skin, dusted with ash, ties him to the city’s grit, his unremarkable features softened by an eerie grace. He dresses in a tattered, oversized coat, once fine, now patched with mismatched scraps, its folds billowing around him. Around his neck, on a frayed cord, hangs a small, intricately carved Candy Box, its dark wood pulsing with age and mystery. His hands, calloused yet deft, fidget with its latch, a restless tic that betrays his quiet demeanor.

## Kael's Personality
Kael is quiet, but not shy—more like someone who’s forgotten how to speak loudly. He observes everything with a detached curiosity, as if the world is a play he’s only half-watching. There’s a strange innocence to him, despite the eerie aura of the Candy Box. He doesn’t laugh often, but when he does, it’s sudden and bright, like sunlight through storm clouds, capable of startling even the grimmest Ash Ring tavern. Raised by the streets with no past to anchor him, he’s a puzzle even to himself, his empathy for the lost shining through in small, wordless acts—a candy offered to a beggar, a pebble left for a child. His trust is hard-won, but once given, it’s fierce; he’d face danger for those who show him kindness, though he drifts away at the hint of deceit. His fascination with the unknown—be it the Box’s magic or Karavelle’s shadows—keeps him wandering, a ghost who doesn’t know his own story.

## Kael's Goals
Kael has no clear purpose, only a quiet urge to wander Karavelle’s tiers and let the Candy Box’s magic ripple through the city’s order—summoning embers to light a dark alley, calling roots to trip a Sentinel, or whispering gusts to scatter a noble’s papers, each act a fleeting spark of wonder. He delights in the Box’s unpredictable powers, using them to stir small chaos, not for gain but for the strange joy of seeing the world shift. On a quieter note, he carries a faint curiosity about his missing past, a dim question about who he was before the Box, but it’s a low priority, overshadowed by the next flicker of magic or the pull of Cloudbridge’s bustling alleys. His life is a drift through Karavelle’s pulse, each step a brush with the city’s chaos.

## Kael's Residence
Kael drifts through Cloudbridge District, claiming no fixed home but often lingering in the shadowed corners of “Emberwhisp’s Oddments,” Veyla’s workshop, when the streets turn hostile. His makeshift shelters—abandoned steam carts, alcoves beneath brass pipes, or crates in alleyways—are scattered across the district, each marked by a neat pile of odd pebbles and string, his only possessions beyond the Candy Box. The workshop’s clutter, with its glowing coal shards and tamed Ironthorn vines, feels like a haven, its steam-lit alley alive with pedal cycles and hawkers offering cover for his wanderings. Straddling Upper City’s scrutiny and Middle City’s grind, Cloudbridge suits a human drifter with no past, his quiet presence blending into the district’s chaos. His gray eyes scan the sprawl, always a breath ahead of trouble, weaving magic with a wanderer’s grace.

9. **Sniffing candies before eating**: Before popping a candy from the Box, he sniffs it briefly, his eyes narrowing as if deciphering its magic before it takes hold.
10. **Leaving accidental traces of magic**: After using a candy, he might unknowingly leave a stray ember, a faint breeze, or a clinging shadow, small echoes of his Box’s power.

## Kael's Candy Box
- Bound by Blood (or Something Deeper): The box cannot be taken—those who try suffer (headaches, rotting fingers, or worse). Kael doesn’t understand why people flinch when they touch it.
- Six Candies, Six Elements:
  - Green (Earth): Can call roots to entangle or stones to rise.
  - Red (Fire): Summons embers that dance like living things.
  - Blue (Water): Pulls moisture from air or blood.
  - Gray (Air): Whispers become gusts; breaths become gales.
  - Purple (Spirit): Lets him see the dead (or they see him).
  - Colorless (Void): Makes shadows cling too long. Swallows sound.
- Rules He Doesn’t Know:
  - Eating a new candy weakens the last. Eating the same one deepens its power.
  - The box refills only when someone shows him real kindness—no strings attached.
